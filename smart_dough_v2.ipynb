    "# Smart Dough 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "In Smart Sourdough 1.0, you are given the ability to build a custom dough with a custom schedule. While this is great, most of us probably have a couple of go-to breads that we like to bake. For these go-to breads, we probably have set quantities that we use each time, and a standard schedule that we follow for that dough.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the flexibility of Smart Sourdough 1.0 is great, sometimes you just want to print out a recipe fast. The idea of Smart Sourdough 2.0 is that, instead of being asked to build your dough and schedule from scratch each time, you'll just be able to select from a dropdown menu which of your go-to breads you want. That's the only decision you have to make, and you'll be given your schedule, and quantities to add at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop Smart Sourdough 2.0, I've started with my standard loaf recipe. In time, I'll add the ability to add new custom recipes and schedules. Ideally, I think the idea I have is that SDv1 will be used as a tool to create new recipes. In SDv1, I can add the capability at the end to save a recipe. Then in SDv2, I'll add the capability to load all saved recipes. But for now, just to get started, I'm using my standard loaf and schedule.\n",

    "My best country loaf specs:\n",
    "- ~725g loaf.\n",
    "- Shipton's Mill strong white and wholewheat flours, filtered tap water and table salt.\n",
    "- 18.5% (21.5%) wholewheat, 78% (80%) hydration, 20% (18%) levain, 2.4% (2.2%) salt.\n",
    "- Levain built at 1:2:2 for 5 hours, kept at 28C.\n",
    "- 1 hour autolyse, 4.5 hour bulk, 30 minutes bench rest and 12 hour retard in the fridge.\n",
    "- Baked for 30 minutes with steam at 250C, finished at 200C for 10 minutes."
