    "# Smart Dough 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tool for doing all the necessary calculations before you make bread. It starts off by asking you to make some decisions about the dough - things such as how much bread you want to make, what hydration you want, how much wholewheat you want to use, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this initial round of questions, you will also be asked some questions about your schedule. You'll be asked things like when you want to start, how long you want to autolyse, how long to bulk ferment, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after all this, the app will output a schedule you can use, that details exactly how much of each ingredient needs to be added at each step. At the end, it will also give you a summary of the dough specs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, once you're ready to go, answer the questions below and get baking!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this app makes several assumptions, listed below:\n",
    "- your bread will only contain white and wholewheat flour, never any other kind of flour.\n",
    "- your levain will also only contain white and wholewheat flour, never any other kind of flour.\n",
    "- your levain is 100% hydration, and you will always build your levain at 1\\:2\\:2 (starter\\:flour\\:water).\n",
    "- the workflow will always follow the format of an autolyse, followed by a warm bulk ferment, and finally a long final proof (retard) in the fridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of terms in bread baking that mean different things depending on who you ask. Below are my definitions for all the terms used in the app:\n",
    "- **flour mix (and percentage wholewheat):** for any amount of dough, the total amount of flour in the dough (including all flour types, as well as flour from the levain) is taken to equal 100%. When asking for the percentage of wholewheat, this corresponds to the proprortion of the *total flour* that is wholewheat. So say you choose 20%, that means that 20% of all flour in the dough will be wholewheat. Note that the app takes into account the percentage wholewheat in your levain and makes the necessary adjustments.\n",
    "- there are lots more, come back and finish this section at some stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas for improving the app\n",
    "- Finish the definitions section.\n",
    "- Give an error message for the questions if an answer is out of range.\n",
    "- Add the ability to save the final output as a file.\n",
    "- Specify the number of flours used, for the dough as well as the starter.\n",
    "- Customise the ratio with which you build your levain.\n",
    "- Automatically detect when activities run overnight and add a line then, instead of hardcoding them in.\n",
    "- Change the input to a table format, rather than individually prompted questions."
